# To do:
- everytime we complete a detection, we will erase the /temp folder and its frames, so we can make a new prediction
# Pose Detection Concerns/Complications
- Resolution:
  - padding on tiktok videos might confuse the ml model.

- Repeated pose detection? 
  - too many repeats could be a concern because the same frame might repeat again, so we will have many duplicates.
    - what should we do?
